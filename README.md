# Project in Bioinformatics about Mfold 
## Fall 2023, Aarhus University 

This repository contains the code for my implementation of Mfold. The code was generated as part of a PiB project at the master in Bioinformatics. 

### Mfold_original 
The file Mfold_original.py contains the simplest version of Mfold, which coresponds to the origial one. 

### Mfold combined
The folder Mfold_combined contains a script that can handle different parameters. It can be called as the original version and with some improvements for folding.
